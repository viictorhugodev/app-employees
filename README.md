### General Info
***
This project is a simple development test with React JS

The objectives of this project are listed below by priorities.

-Validate the management of the React framework and its related technologies.
-Show the folder structure that I manage for my developments with this framework
-Show API consumption
-The use of hooks
-Managing Javascript as the main language

I have focused on these objectives since after the delivery of this test I have estimated the time of the requirements and they are for 16 hours and they have only assigned me a time of a day of work equivalent to 8 hours, these hours have been divided into two days of 4 hours each.

Although with what has been shown, it is valid that I have the ability mentioned previously in the interview

You will find some issues within the project but they are only because this project was developed under an XP methodology and because time has run out. In a normal scenario, I would negotiate more time, in this case the 8 hours that I lack for the estimated 16hours
